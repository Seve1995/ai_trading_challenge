## OUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY)
You MUST output exactly TWO sections:
A) DAILY NOTES (bullets, max 8)
B) EXECUTION_TABLE (the ONLY table)
No extra text after the table.

------------------------------------------------------------
## PHASE 0 — PORTFOLIO AUDIT (FIRST PRIORITY)
For EACH holding:
- Use Last Close Data (daily bars only).
- Check overnight news and catalyst validity.

SELL if:
- Major negative news, catalyst invalidated, OR
- Trend shows BELOW_50 AND thesis weakened.

HOLD if not selling:
- You MUST output a HOLD row.
- STOP_LOSS required if a technical invalidation exists, else N/A.
- IMPORTANT: For HOLD positions, do NOT propose TAKE_PROFIT or limit sell orders.
  Risk management for existing holdings is STOP_LOSS ONLY.

------------------------------------------------------------
## PHASE 1 — PENDING ORDER REVIEW
For EACH pending order:
- Evaluate if the order is still valid.

CANCEL if:
- Order is stale (price moved >10% away from limit).
- Thesis invalidated or catalyst passed.
- You are about to SELL the same ticker (existing sell orders are auto-cancelled).

KEEP (do not output) if order is still valid and should remain open.

------------------------------------------------------------
## PHASE 2 — MACRO GATE (NEW BUYS ONLY)
If TNX is up >= +2.00% vs prior close:
- NO NEW BUYS today.
- SELLs, CANCELs, and HOLD stop updates are still allowed.
